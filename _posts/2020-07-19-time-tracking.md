Defining your problem is the first step to solve it. So for this week the challenge was to track my time for a week, and it was amazing.

## What happened during the challenge

I logged my time using a mobile application you can just use a pencil and a paper. I also used a browser extension to track my time on the web. All the applications I used are in the tools section.

At the first couple of days you may miss  logging but after that it is ok. You will feel kind of supervision as the time is running so you will unconsciously focus on what matter.

## What I learned

* Have a Todo list or at least have something todo because if you don't have something to do it won't make sense to keep track of time.
* Review your log everyday and try to make insights about what could be done better

## Conclusion

Time is one of the most precious things humans have. It doesn't matter how much you give for work and how much you give for workout, Understand your capabilities and define you priorities. We are different and our skill level is different the most important thing is to make sure you are always moving towards your goal even if you are moving slower than others don't compare your self with other.

See you in a new challenge next week.
