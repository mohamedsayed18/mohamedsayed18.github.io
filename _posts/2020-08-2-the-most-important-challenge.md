# The most important challenge

In my opinion the most important skill anyone should have is the ability to keep going.

Because life is not linear, not everything goes as planned, you will not be happy everyday and you will not have the same energy everyday.

**Note**: Planning is still important, or the most important

Let me emphasize that your ability to keep going and stay focus on your dreams is a skill not just feeling or a matter of motivation.

## How to improve this skill

#### Measure your progress 

Measure the time you spend developing, Measure how fast are you moving to your goal, Measure how many times you feel down and don't want to do anything. And by time you can increase your limits.

#### Discipline

Doing what you suppose to be doing no matter what. Anyone can do anything when he has the desire to do. But what makes difference is to do it even if you don't like it. Having a good plan and time management will help you in this.

#### Make it visible

Make yourself accountable. tell a friend that you will finish this course or build this project by the end of this week. Write on social media. These will make you responsible and you will not like to appear as lazy or a loser in front of your friends or family.

#### Stay with people that are grinding

You will easily do as these people to because as humans we tend to follow the group of people around us and you will be easily affected by them. This step can happen online. You can make a group of people how are interested in the same thing you do and start to work together.

And before all of this having your goal well defined, You are able to write it down not just in your mind is very important. see you next week.
