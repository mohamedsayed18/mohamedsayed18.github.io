Having a plan is very important even if you think your goals are clear and you don't need a plan
to achieve your goals, having a plan will help you to reflect and refactor your goal into small steps
you will not feel overwhelmed by the size of your goals. By the time you will become more experience
about planning your goals and projects.

So for this week I decided to make a plan for the month and for the week and a set of todo for everyday.
I hope this will help me to do more and become more productive.

The results for the past challenge were good, every time I try to cancel the block and access the Youtube
I feel guilty. So this make me more aware of one of the most important assets for anyone which is the time

This blog post is a day later but I'm happy that I kept the habit of writing for the 2nd week in row.
