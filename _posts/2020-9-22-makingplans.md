For this week I'm planning to do a long term and short term goals

During making my goals I followed these steps:

1. Make a list of all goals
2. Choose just one or two goals
3. Write the benefits you will get by achieving this goals and disadvantages you will get by not achieving this goal
4. Write a steps to achieve this goal, what is the expected obstacle and how to overcome it.

In the next post I will give you a personal example.
