For this week I'm planning to do a long term and short term goals
The channels I will use as reference:

* Ali Mohamed Ali ()
* Daniel Bourke ![How I became a productivity machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zQZoknhBzw)
* Scott Young ![Do Long-Term Goals Bring Happiness?](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/06/13/long-term-goals/)


As a punishment I will edit this post at the end on Friday, and tell you my plan.
