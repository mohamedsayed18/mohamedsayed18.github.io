For the last week I didn't keep the habit of writing a plan for everyday.
But the plan I did at the beginning of the week made me more focused and I felt more productive again

But for this week I'm planning to add to make a todo in a bullet journal style.

Your goal will keep you motivated so keep your eyes on the goal.
