I'm writing this post to tell you about my goal and how I'm planning to achieve it.

My goal is land a job as Robotics software developer or a similar job as a software developer.

To achieve this goal I need to gain the following skills:

* Python
* C++
* ROS

I will focus on the C++, I will start with this ![playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlZ5ZY0_ITg&list=PLPt2dINI2MIbMba7tpx3qvmgOsDlpITwG)
